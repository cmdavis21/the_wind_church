Together, they have faithfully served in various ministry roles, blessed with three wonderful children. Pastor Singletary served under Dr. Michael Edwards for 18 years, holding positions such as Associate Minister, Youth Pastor, Young Adult Facilitator, Children's Church Team member, Church Council Chairperson, Elder, and Assistant Pastor. His extensive experience and dedication prepared him for his current role as Senior Pastor."
